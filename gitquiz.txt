go to email, open terminal and copy and paste the email I sent to myself to git clone.
create a text file typing in terminal: gedit and then file name
edit text file by typing in whatever you need to in the white tab that opens up
save text file by saving the file and then on terminal in your repository do:-git add, -git commit -m "Add description", -git push
after git push you will have to login to github on terminal
the file you created is now saved on github
